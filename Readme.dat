#A_SNR_Code
This is an updated version of the hydrodynamic code I wrote from strach and was used in:
-Impact of the ERF on the structure and evolution of SNR.
By M. Romero (me), Y. Ascasibar, J. Paoluš, R. Wünsch and M. Mollá.
Published in MNRAS, Volume 505, Issue 4, pp.5301-5310.

Right now, it only solves hydrodynamics in 1D for SNR explosions. Although I want to recover the option to use an arbitrary IC.
To use this code, first write in terminal
> make main
And now write
>./main.exe
It will tell you instructions on how to run this code without too much effort.

The only thing you need is an initial condition. You need to give a single file with five parameters:
-First number is the mass density of the ISM in g
-Second number is the total energy density of the ISM in erg/cm3
-Third number is the momentum density in g/s/cm2
-Fourth number is the ambient metallicity
-Fifth number is the extent of the simulation box in cm
-Sixth number is the initial SNR explosion energy
-Last number is the initial SNR ejected mass
You can see an example in IC/Example/IC_n1_E1e51.txt

Now you run the .exe . Results will be in Output folder, you will find three types of files
>d[X]_Z[A]_P[Y]_t=[T]kyr.txt
Where [X] is mass density in terms of Hydrogen mass per cm3, [A] is the metallicity, [Y] is the pressure (in K/cm3), and [T] is the time in kyr.
Those values are referred to the last cell, which is supposed to be the ambient ISM.
You will find inside several columns of data without any legend, and here is where the second file enters
>key.txt
This file tells you the magnitude and units of each column. You can deactivate this option in define.h by turning 'KEY_ON' to 1.
>Map_Z0.02.dat
This file provide a long table of values.
Given a density and pressure (first and second columns, respectively), it tells you the value that other magnitudes will take (temperature, cooling time, heating rate, etc) in the simulation.
This file is useful to check the quantities related to the state of the gas that a particular simulation will take.
You can deactivate this file as well in define.h by changing 'CREATE_MAP' to 0

#### CHANGING COOLING AND HEATING ####
In order to handle cooling and heating, you need to provide three tables per file.
-First column of all tables is the density in g/cm3
-Second column of all tables is the pressure in erg/cm3
-Third column is either Temperature (K), energy density loss rate (erg/cm3/s) or heating rate (erg/s).
You can see examples in 'IC/Examples' folder. Temperature table is called EoS (from 'Equation of State').
